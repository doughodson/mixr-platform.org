title:  "Domain Name Change and Movement to a Secure Website"
---
We are changing the hosting website and the domain for the MIXR project.  Hosting the site is down using GitHub pages in conjunction with Jekyll to create static pages.  The new domain name is mixr.dev to better indicate the nature of this project (software development) and by default is a secure (https) site.

title:  "Domain Name Change and Move to a Secure Website"
---
We are changing the hosting website and the domain name for the MIXR project.  We are now hosting the site using GitHub pages in conjunction with the Jekyll system to create the static content.  The new domain name is [mixr.dev](https://www.mixr.dev) which is a secure (https) site.

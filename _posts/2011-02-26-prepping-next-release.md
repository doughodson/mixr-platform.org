title:  "Prepping Next Release"
---
The next release of OpenEaagles is due out soon. Much work has gone into the framework in several areas, including an improved IR modeling environment, support for Visual Studio 2010, support for MinGW (this include Code::Blocks and CodeLite IDE support), a better set of GUI examples, etc. Expect a new developmental version to be posted soon.

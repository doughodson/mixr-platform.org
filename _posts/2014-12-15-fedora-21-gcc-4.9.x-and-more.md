title:  "Fedora 21, GCC 4.9.x and More..."

Just compiled the oe framework using GCC 4.9.x which is part of Fedora 21 Linux - everything checks out ok. As a result, the "Linux Notes" page has been updated to include more Fedora or "yum"-based installation instructions.

We plan to support the [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) system and associated toolchain in the future.

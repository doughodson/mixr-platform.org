title:  "A Busy Week Comes to a Close"

Thanks to all those who visited our booth during I/ITSEC 2006. We were pleasantly surprised by the number of developers and companies already working with OpenEaagles and the interest by so many others. Make sure to report back on applications you build or any questions you encounter! So many questions were asked that we decided to start up an FAQ page. We are busy writing answers. Check back soon.

title:  "SimpleOtw Updated"
---
The simple out-the-window heads-up display application "SimpleOtw" has been updated. The application utilizes a few components from OpenEaagles but primarily leverages OpenSceneGraph to draw the 3D graphics. It is now available on Sourceforge. The package now includes all third-party libraries "SimpleOtw3rdParty" from OpenSceneGraph to link against, and required Dlls to run. Everything was compiled using Visual C++ 2005 Express Service Pack 1.

title:  "MIXR Platform v18.01 Released"
---
This release includes a number of improvements in terms of overall platform organization and implementation.

Two libraries have been significantly revised to simplify I/O linkage definition and host Image Generator interface specification (CIGI in particular). The included changelog documents the list of improvements, including rationale. We have also bundled, renamed and improved the SimpleOTW visual application as an example image generator within the 'examples' package - it is now called mainIgViewer.

This release is fully compatible with both Windows and Linux and can be compiled with Visual Studio 2015, 2017, and the latest versions of GCC. It is also compatible with CentOS 7.

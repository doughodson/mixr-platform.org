title:  "ThrustMaster HOTAS Cougar Profile Loader for Linux Posted"
---
The Thrustmaster HOTAS Cougar is a replica U.S. Air Force F-16 block 52 controller (stick and throttle). A Windows-only Control Panel is supplied with the Cougar to configure various options such as the use of the Microstick axes. Normally the Microstick cannot be read from Linux because it cannot be configured from Linux (no Control Panel exists to set them!). This released Linux application can read profile files (that yes, have been created with the Windows Control Panel) and configure the Cougar so that Linux applications can read the Microstick. This enables the high quality, reasonably priced HOTAS Cougar to be used more effectively with flight simulation applications. See the Hotas Cougar page for more information.

title:  "Fedora 14 and Ubuntu 10.10"
---
A few changes to the Linux Makefiles have been made to ensure all examples compile cleanly with Ubuntu 10.10. A minor change to tutorial #5 is also included to illustrate how constructed objects can validate their data. This feature is leveraged by the OE parser to ensure input files are valid. The developmental version as of today reflects these changes and cleanly compiles with both Fedora 14 and Ubuntu 10.10.

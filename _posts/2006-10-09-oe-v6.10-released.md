JSBSim interface class added to OpenEaagles vehicles library and JSBSim library added to 3rd party support packages for Visual C++ 2003 and 2005 Express. We still need to do some fine tuning, but it works. A simple example that exercises JSBSim is also in the works. Also, the Doxygen configuration files have been updated to generate optional collaboration diagrams.

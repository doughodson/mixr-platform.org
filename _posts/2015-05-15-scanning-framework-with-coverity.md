title:  "Scanning Framework with Coverity"
---
We have started using Coverity's online scan static analysis tool as another quality check on the framework source code. The posted OpenEaagles project with analysis results at Coverity's website can be found [here](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/5133).

Coverity's web interface to analysis results is impressive and provides useful meaningful information with few apparent false negatives (a common problem with static code analysis tools). Generally speaking, the framework codebase is quite clean - but it did reveal a few issues to address before next release.

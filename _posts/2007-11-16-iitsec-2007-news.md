Stop by and see the variety of applications that can be built utilizing the OpenEaagles framework at I/ITSEC this year (Nov 26-29). Knowledgeable folks will be available to answer questions and development activities. We will also have copies of the new book titled "Designing & Implementing Virtual and Constructive Simulations Using OpenEaagles" on display (see below). We will be located in the CACI booth # 2731.

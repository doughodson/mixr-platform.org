Wright State University has posted a Doxygen-based set of documentation for OpenEaagles. They have reformatting much of the source code to facilitate comment and documentation extraction. This online set of documentation contains more information than our first cut with Doxygen. See the Documentation page for more information. WSU is also offering courses in simulation this Spring and Summer that will utilize OpenEaagles. More information to come.

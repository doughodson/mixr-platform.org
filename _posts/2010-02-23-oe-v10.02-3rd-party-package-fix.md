title:  "OE v10.02 3rd Party Package Fix"
---
After 10.02 was posted a problem was found with the FTGL library supplied in 3rd Party dependency package. The problem is associated with a Visual Studio project setting called "Whole Program Optimization". Without getting into a long discussion as to what it does and all of the wonderful advantages it offers in optimizing code across modules, the lesson learned is - leave the default setting alone!

A new version of the 3rd Party package has been posted.

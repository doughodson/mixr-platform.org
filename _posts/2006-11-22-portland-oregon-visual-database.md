title:  "Portland, Oregon Visual Database"
---
Our first open source visual database is in the works. It was created by Rob Subr and will be shown at I/ITSEC 2006 along with a simple out-the-window (OTW) application called SimpleOTW. Both the database and application will be posted on this site shortly. SimpleOTW was created leveraging OpenSceneGraph's scene graph rendering capabilities and OpenEaagles for input file definition, parsing, and network support. If you happen to be at I/ITSEC, please stop by for a demo. OpenEaagles can be found on display in both booth #2077 and the General Dynamics booth #1815. We can also copy the database to your memory stick if desired. (It will save you time on the download as it's over 100MB in size.)

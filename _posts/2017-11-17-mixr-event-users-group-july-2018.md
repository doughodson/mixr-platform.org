title:  "MIXR Event / Users Group July 2018!"
---
There is a tentative plan to organize a session within the WorldComp 2018 conference for "mixed reality simulations" - in the military, they are often referred to as "distributed virtual simulations" or even Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) simulations due to the way they are assembled. The planned conference session is open to all the above!

The conference will be held next July at the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas, NV. The plan includes a formal session with paper presentations on these simulation types, including methodologies, tools, and technologies to support training, test, human factors research, and exploratory analysis.

In conjunction with the formal session, we are looking to set aside time for MIXR specific interactions including tutorials, general information sharing, Q&A, and socializing, etc. In order to gauge the level of interest, please [contact me](mailto:doug@sidechannel.net) and/or reply in the [MIXR forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mixr).

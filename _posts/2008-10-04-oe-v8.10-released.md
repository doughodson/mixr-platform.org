Lots of details addressed in this version including our obsession with eliminating as many Visual Studio warnings as possible. The naming convention of input files has been changed. Files named with an extension of ".d" have been changed to ".epp" to indicate it's an input file used in the process of building a final description. Final loadable input files previously named with an extension of ".dd" has been changed to ".edl". EDL stands for Eaagles Description Language

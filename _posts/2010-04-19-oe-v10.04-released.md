Latest version of OpenEaagles posted. This version principally updates the previous stable by correcting minor inconsistencies and use of the LCreal datatype across the framework. Now LCreal can be defined as either a single (float) or double (double) datatype for math operations. Other updates include the addition of user method which allows users to process PDUs that are not handled by the default PDU handlers.

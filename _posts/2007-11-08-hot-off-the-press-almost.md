A new book focused on developing virtual and constructive simulations is in the process of being published by The Wright State Research Institute. It is titled the "Design & Construction of Virtual and Constructive Simulations Using OpenEaagles." This 280-page book consists of eight chapters as follows: 1) Introduction, 2) Background on Modeling and Simulation, 3) Basic Data Types & Classes, 4) Crafting Simulation, 5) Constructive Simulation, 6) Input Language, 7) Developing Compliant Simulations and 8) Developing Virtual Simulations. To our knowledge, this is the first hands-on book to cover the design and implementation of both virtual and construction simulation applications. The book will come with example applications based off of the upcoming OpenEaagles version.

title:  "OE Developmental Version Posted"
---
New developmental version posted. The most visible aspect of this version is a new OpenEaagles "glut" library that contains GLUT-specific graphics classes. This change promotes a cleaner separation of GLUT functionality from the more general OpenGL-based graphics toolkit. Also included in this release are two new applications that demonstrate how to display OE-based graphics using Fox and FLTK GUI toolkits.

Got a chance to look, touch and mess around with the Thustmaster HOTAS Warthog and the Saitek PRO Flight X-65F Combat Control System today - initial impression "Wow!" - very nice sets of hardware for the money. We will ensure that configuration (input) files for OE examples are set up to support both.

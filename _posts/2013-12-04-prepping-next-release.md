title:  "Prepping Next Release"
---
The next release of OpenEaagles is due out soon. As always, much work has gone into the framework in several areas including the addition of a small, simple, reconfigurable 4 degrees of freedom aerodynamic model (i.e., perfect for autonomous control), a number of minor bug fixes, improved code formatting and documentation, and improved organization and naming of framework examples. Also planned is the inclusion of an experimental [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/)-based network handler. This opens the door to a wide range of interesting networking capabilities.

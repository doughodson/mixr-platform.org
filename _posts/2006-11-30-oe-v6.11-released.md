title:  "OE v6.11 Released"
---
This version includes the new 3D EADI instrument, a new example application (mainSim3) which uses it, and a CIGI interface for IG systems. With the example application driving the SimpleOTW application you can now "fly" around our recently released visual database. Note: For applications that utilize JSBSim and are compiled with Visual C++ Express 2005, please compile in Debug mode otherwise your application may fail. We hope to have a solution soon. December 1, 2006 Update! The problem with building an OpenEaagles based application linked with JSBSim under Visual C++ 2005 Express has apparently been solved. A new posting of OpenEaagles with a more inclusive set of 3rd party libraries will be posted soon.

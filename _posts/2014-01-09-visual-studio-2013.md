OpenEaagles compiles cleanly with Visual Studio 2013, but, not all of 3rd party packages do, such as [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) version 2.5.0. As soon as all 3rd party packages compile cleanly with VS 2013, an update of OpenEaagles3rdParty libraries will be posted.

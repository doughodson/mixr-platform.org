title:  "Issues Addressed Leveraging Coverity"
---
Leveraging Coverity's static analyzer results, we have reduced "defect density" statistic for the entire OpenEaagles framework to only 0.12. To put this number in context, Linux, the gold standard in terms of quality benchmarks has a defect density of only 0.59 and typical proprietary code measures in about 0.68.

Of the initial 175 defects identified by Coverity, 139 have been addressed. It should be stated that no particular issue raised significant concerns, but stomping out potential issues is both good practice and yields higher quality software.

Soon, we will be posting a new release which captures these improvements.

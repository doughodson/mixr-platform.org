title:  "Adopting CMake Build System"
---
We hope to fully adopt cmake as our build system for the next release of the framework. Moving to cmake provides several advantages including support for the most recent versions of Visual Studio, more visible user selectable compiling options, and it's a valuable tool to implement continuous integration concepts.

FYI: Continuous integration (CI) is a software engineering practice in which isolated changes are immediately tested and reported on when they are added to a larger code base. The goal is to provide rapid feedback so that if a defect is introduced into the code base, it can be identified and corrected as soon as possible.

title:  "Version Numbering Scheme Changed"
---
After some discussion recently held between the core team and forum members, we decided to change the version numbering scheme used for OpenEaagles. This new scheme will follow the "Year.Month" style, also known as the "Ubuntu version scheme".

Past versions using the older "Year_MonthDay" (for example 2008_1025) style have been updated throughout the website for the sake of consistency.

title:  "Updates to 3rd Party Source Package"
---
Several updates were made to this package; specifically, the build script, documentation (i.e., README), and dependencies (ZeroMQ, bison, and OpenSceneGraph). It is now included as part of the 18.01 release. Work has begun on the next set of improvements, slated for release early next year.

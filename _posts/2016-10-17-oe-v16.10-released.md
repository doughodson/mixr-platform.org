title:  "OE v16.10 Released"
---
The latest stable version of OpenEaagles posted. This release includes a few code corrections and adjustments to improve consistency. The major change for this release includes the renaming of include file extensions from *.h to *.hpp. This was done to make explicit the nature of file contents â€“ namely, C++ declarations and/or template code. The practice of clearly differentiating C from C++ is not always done but is considered good practice within the community as it yields clarity of file purpose and other benefits. One particular benefit to moving this direction concerns code compilation using precompiled headers (e.g., compiling a *.h file to either *.pch or *.gch to improve performance) - if C++ code is found in a *.h file, a warning often results.

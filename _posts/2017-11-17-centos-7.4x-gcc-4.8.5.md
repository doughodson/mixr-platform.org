title:  "CentOS 7.4.x - GCC 4.8.5"
---
MIXR has been tested with CentOS 7.4 which includes GCC 4.8.5; everything compiles, links and executes as expected. We strive to maintain compatibility with this important Linux distribution as it's often accepted as an approved operating system to be used within certain facilities and/or operating environments.

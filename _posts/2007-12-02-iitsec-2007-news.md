I/ITSEC 2007 was a great success this year for OpenEaagles. Special thanks to the CACI folks for providing us some booth space for an attractive display. The first printed copies of "Designing & Implementing Virtual and Constructive Simulations Using OpenEaagles" arrived via UPS the first day of the show. Talk about cutting it close! By the end of the show, we had sold out and started taking advance orders. Shortly we will be posting a new OpenEaagles version that compliments the book examples.

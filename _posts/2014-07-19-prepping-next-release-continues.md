title:  "Prepping Next Release Continues..."
---
We are planning on adding behavior tree modeling capability to the framework in this release followed by the inclusion of a substantial amount of work contributed by the [Command and Control Laboratory](http://www.labc2.ita.br/) at the [Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA)](http://www.ita.br/) in Brazil (in the next release). ITA has extended some of the existing behavior modeling capabilities of the framework by providing interfaces to the [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) scripting language, the [SOAR](https://soar.eecs.umich.edu/) production system-based cognitive architecture and the [CLIPS](http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/) expert system.

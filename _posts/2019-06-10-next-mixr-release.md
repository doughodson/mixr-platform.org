title:  "Next MIXR Release"
---
Work to release the next version is in progress; it will be directly supported for Visual Studio 2017 (x32) and Visual Studio 2019 (x64) with supplied compiled dependency libraries. It (as always) can be compiled and used within the Linux ecosystem. Much work has already been accomplished to improve the configuration of inputs associated with number values with numbers associated with a particular unit (i.e., quantities).

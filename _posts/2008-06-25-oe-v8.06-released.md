title:  "OE v8.06 Released"
---
A new version which rolls up all fixes found to date and breaks out the FOX, FLTK and wxWidgets GUI interface classes into their own respective packages has been posted. Fixes include support for 64-bit Linux, GCC 4.3 compilers and better adherence to coding standards in a few areas. GUI examples and packages will be available for download directly from the new GUI Support page soon. Starting with this version we have transitioned to the standard GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) to ensure maximum flexibility with code used in both open and commercial settings. See License page for additional details.

title:  "SubrScene Image Generator Now Available"
---
The SubrScene visualization toolkit has been released into the open-source world. SubrScene has been used extensively as the primary image generator (IG) system for OpenEaagles-based applications. This includes driving single or multiple video displays (channels) and domes. A typical configuration for assembling an interactive virtual simulator consists of the execution of an OpenEaagles-based application (the simulation), coupled with an IG system, like SubrScene to drive scenegraph based visuals, such as heads-up displays. A good mix is to utilize OpenEaagles graphics capabilities to draw interactive operator displays such as heads-down devices with its rich set of instruments while tapping into SubrScene's scenegraph capabilities to draw complex 3D visuals. With SubrScene's SDK, scenegraph capabilities can be embedded into OpenEaagles-based operator displays.

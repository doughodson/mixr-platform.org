This version streamlines the installation process for users of Visual C++ 2003 and Visual C++ 2005 Express. A package of precompiled 3rd party support tools such as freetype, FTGL, freeglut, FOX GUI Toolkit, and FLTK has been supplied to greatly simplify a Windows installation. This version has also been compiled with GCC in Fedora Core 5.

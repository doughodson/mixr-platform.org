title:  "Prepping Next Release"
---
The next release of OpenEaagles is due out soon. In this release, a few bugs have been squashed (due to Forum feedback) and much effort has gone into improving the code base itself by revising some existing code to adhere to more stringent coding standards. Expect a new release to be posted within the next few weeks. As always, progress can be followed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/doughodson).

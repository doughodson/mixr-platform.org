---
The latest stable version of OpenEaagles posted. Much work has gone into the framework in several areas including the addition of a small, simple, reconfigurable 4 degrees of freedom aerodynamic model (i.e., perfect for autonomous control), new Factory classes for all of the libraries, a number of bug fixes, improved code formatting and documentation, and improved organization and naming of framework examples. This release also includes an experimental [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/)-based network handler with the examples.

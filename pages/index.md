## Enabling the Construction of Robust, Scalable, Virtual and Constructive, Stand-alone and Distributed Mixed Reality Applications ##

The Mixed Reality Simulation Platform (MIXR), or simply, the Mixer Platform, is a multi-platform simulation platform designed to help simulation engineers and software developers rapidly prototype and build robust, scalable, virtual and constructive, and stand-alone and distributed simulation applications. It has been used extensively to build applications that demand deterministic real-time performance. This includes applications used to support human factor studies, operator training, or the development of complete distributed virtual simulation systems. The Mixer Platform has also been used to build stand-alone and distributed constructive applications oriented at system performance analysis.

MIXR is a mature software simulation platform that has been in active development for over a decade. The framework includes interoperability interfaces to support the development of distributed applications, as it includes interfaces that support the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocol. Numerous DIS compliant distributed simulation applications have been built using this framework as the foundation.

The platform is described in the book titled “Design & Construction of Virtual and Constructive Simulations Using OpenEaagles” (OpenEaagles was its previous name). This is one of the first modeling and simulation books published that focuses on the construction techniques of virtual and constructive performance-oriented high fidelity simulations.
